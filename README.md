# ðŸŒ± Puff Finder

A listing app for querying cannabis seed companies, strains, brands, products, batches, retailers and studies. Built primarily with [Vue 2](https://v2.vuejs.org/) alongside [Vuidget](https://github.com/DJanoskova/Vuidget) as a way to make a Vue web app an embeddable widget in HTML. In this case, a page supported through WordPress (Eco Nature Theme). Data was sourced from [Otreeba and the Open Cannabis API](https://otreeba.com/) through [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/).

## Project setup

nvm use v14
npm install
